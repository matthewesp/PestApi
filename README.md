#InsectsAPI - Project Apis

This is the official(unofficial?) API for different types of Insects that can be found. 

##Why is this being made?

I have tried looking up various API's that can be used to create a pest control application to no avail. One of my problems came when I tried looking up "Bugs + API" because the word "bugs" is also used as "an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways." When I  tried various other methods of trying to get the data online, I thought I would do justice by create a Repo Hosting one of the first API for Insects.

I would love to use this data in various application that contain infomation on Pest Control CRMs and other Data Applications. One of the main ones being hosting one of the first Insect Data Bases online.
